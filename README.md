üõ† Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and handled missing data.
Normalized and scaled features to improve model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized relationships between features and wine quality.
Identified key factors influencing wine quality.

Model Development:

Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM models.
Compared accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

üìä Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
